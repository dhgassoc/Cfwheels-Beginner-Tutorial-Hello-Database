Cfwheels 2.0 Beginner Tutorial: Hello Database Source Code

On the CfWheels website there is a Beginner Tutorial on  how to create a Hello Database CRUD interface.  This code is from https://guides.cfwheels.org/docs/beginner-tutorial-hello-database.  I used a mySql 5.6 server.  

Some programmers just want to download a sample / example and start by modifing a working model.  Now that I have this example working in my environment, I decided to upload it for other to use.

Some of the "Beginner-Tutorial-Hello-Database" guide has been incorporated into the code as comments. These comments helped me to learn / understand how the routes and form submits "flow" thru the Controller. 
   
Thanks
